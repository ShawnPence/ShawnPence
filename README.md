### ðŸ˜€ Hello, I'm Shawn Pence

I am a software developer experienced in C#, SQL, Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), VB.NET and
 various other programming languages. I love to teach and learn from others and prefer to build my career by
 building stronger teams. I have also worked as a systems administrator maintaining AD, Exchange, Hyper-V cluster
 servers, SAN, and various network equipment, and have worked with PowerShell and VBScript to automate my
 sysadmin responsibilities.
 
I'm a bookworm with a passion for lifelong learning. Check my status on GitHub to see what I'm currently
 reading. You can also find a list of recommended books and other learning resources on my personal website.

You can find out more about me at my personal website [https://shawnpence.com/about](https://shawnpence.com/about).

### ðŸ’» Experience

The majority of my programming experience has been with C#, SQL, and VB.NET, but Iâ€™ve also developed
 smaller programs/scripts in Python, VB6, VBScript, C++, JavaScript, PowerShell, and other languages. I've developed
 software in environments ranging from large enterprises to small businesses, but my employers have all been closed-source,
 so you won't see my professional experience reflected in my GitHub contributions chart.

Most recently, I have been a C# / T-SQL developer creating and supporting WinForms and ASP.NET applications
 and the SQL databases used by those applications, automating business processes, creating and maintaining SQL
 Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports, and automating the creation of reports in Excel using C# and/or VB.NET.

### ðŸ“š Current learning goals

These are a few of the areas I'm currently studying and working to improve my knowledge.  I believe in lifelong
 learning, so some of these are areas of strength that I want to make even stronger, others are areas of relative
 weakness where I want to improve
 
* Multithreading and concurrent programming in C#
* Machine Learning
* Python

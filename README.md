### üë®‚Äçüíª Hello, I'm Shawn Pence

I am a software developer experienced in C#, SQL, Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), VB.NET and
 various other programming languages. I love to teach and learn from others and prefer to build my career by
 building stronger teams. 

I have previously worked as a systems administrator maintaining AD, Exchange, Hyper-V cluster
 servers, SAN, and various network equipment (routers, switches, ASA, WLC), and have worked with PowerShell and VBScript to automate my former
 sysadmin responsibilities. My love of automating away my routine tasks lead me away from systems administration to full-time developer roles.
 
I'm a bookworm with a passion for lifelong learning. Check my status on GitHub to see what I'm currently
 reading. You can also find a list of recommended books and other learning resources on my personal website.

You can find out more about me at my personal website [https://shawnpence.com/about](https://shawnpence.com/about).

### üíª Experience

The majority of my programming experience has been with C#, SQL, and VB.NET, but I‚Äôve also developed
 smaller programs/scripts in Python, VB6, VBScript, C++, JavaScript, PowerShell, and other languages. I've developed
 software in environments ranging from large enterprises to small businesses, but my employers have all been closed-source,
 so my professional experience is not reflected in my GitHub contributions chart.

Most recently, I have been a C# / T-SQL developer creating and supporting WinForms and ASP.NET applications
 and the SQL databases used by those applications, automating business processes, creating and maintaining SQL
 Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports, and automating the creation of reports in Excel using C# and/or VB.NET.

### üìö Current learning goals

These are a few of the areas I'm currently studying to improve my knowledge.  I believe in lifelong
 learning, so some of these are areas of strength that I want to make even stronger, others are areas where I want to learn new skills.
 
* Multithreading and concurrent programming in C#
* Entity Framework
* Machine Learning
* Python
* *for fun:* Audio programming *(I would love to learn how to create a software synthesizer - looking for good resources if anyone has recommendations)*
